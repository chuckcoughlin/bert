An example which shows how to use a Lua script to create a new data 
type on the sender port
======================================================================


-- Compile Yarp with Lua binding support

-- Set LUA_CPATH to include Yarp-Lua binding library 
    (e.g., export LUA_CPATH=";;;$YARP_ROOT/bindings/build-lua/?.so")

-- Open a terminal and run yarpserver

-- Open another terminal (lets call this the sender terminal) and type 
   $ yarp write /write 

-- Open another terminal (lets call this the receiver terminal) )and change 
   to the 'simple_modification' directory: 
   $ cd $YARP_ROOT/src/carrier/portmonitor_carrier/example/simple_modification
   $ yarp read /read
  
-- In another terminal connect the port as follow: 
   $ yarp connect /write /read tcp+send.portmonitor+script.lua+file.type_modifier

Now if you write something  in the 'sender' terminal, you will see the text is totaly substituted by a vector. 
For example: 

[sender terminal]
 Hello 
 
[receiver terminal] 
 1.5 2.0 3.0
