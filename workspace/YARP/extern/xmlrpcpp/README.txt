XmlRpc++
--------

XmlRpc++ is an implementation of the XmlRpc protocol written in C++,
based upon Shilad Sen's excellent py-xmlrpc library. It is designed to
make it easy to incorporate XmlRpc client+server support into C++
applications and requires no other libraries.

This version contains several modification (including a change of
namespace from XmlRpc to YarpXmlRpc and the removal of a few classes and
the replacement of the original base64.h which license is unknown with a
different implementation by René Nyffenegger released as BSD) and a few
bug fixes for YARP.
