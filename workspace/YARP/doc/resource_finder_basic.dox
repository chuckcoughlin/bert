@page yarp_resource_finder_basic The ResourceFinder Class (basic)

\author Lorenzo Natale and Elena Ceseracciu

This tutorial shows how to use the yarp::os::ResourceFinder class to organize parameters passed to
modules. The ResourceFinder is a helper class that allows to find and read configuration files from YARP's installation directories or from directories that are user specific (see \ref yarp_data_dirs).

\section rf_basic_intro Introduction

Suppose we wish to write a module called 'rf_basic' that performs random movements of a single joint.
The module is generic, so it can control any of the available joints of one of the limbs of a robot, either a real or a simulated one.

The module should receive the following parameters:

\code
--robot name (the name of the robot)
--part  robotpart (the limb of the robot)
--joint j (the joint we want to control)
\endcode

In the module \e main function we add:

\code
ResourceFinder rf;
rf.configure(argc, argv);
\endcode

This creates an instance of the ResourceFinder, and configures it using data from the command line. We can query the value of the parameters:

\code
std::string robotName=rf.find("robot").asString();
std::string partName=rf.find("part").asString();
int joint=rf.find("joint").asInt32();

cout<<"Running with:"<<endl;
cout<<"robot: "<<robotName.c_str()<<endl;
cout<<"part: "<<partName.c_str()<<endl;
cout<<"joint: "<<joint<<endl;

\endcode

This achieves what we want. The program \e rf_basic can parse the parameters from the command line as desired. For example (we here assume you are in the source directory of rf_basic and that you wrote a valid CMakeLists.txt):

\code
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make

./rf_basic --robot robby --part head --joint 3

Running with:
robot:robby
part:head
joint:3
\endcode

Now suppose we wish to place these configuration parameters in a file called \e config.ini. We can put this file together with the sources in a specific folder called \e randomMotion.

Create the file:
\code
./randomMotion/config.ini
\endcode

Open it with your preferred editor and type:
\code
robot icub
part head
joint 0
\endcode

The code above already achieves what we wanted. The ResourceFinder automatically checks for a parameter `--from` that specifies from which file to read configuration parameters:

\code

./rf_basic --from ../randomMotion/config.ini

robot icub
part head
joint 0
\endcode

Notice that we here assume you are in the \e build directory.

In many cases you don't want to bother about the exact path of the ini file. This happens for example if you are writing a script that executes the module and you don't know the exact configuration of the machine (it could even be running a different operating system!). This is the case for example when writing scripts for the \ref yarpmanager.

But first let's provide the ResourceFinder with a default configuration file so that the user does not have to specify it in the command line (notice that the parameter \e --from overwrites this setting):

\code
ResourceFinder rf;
rf.setVerbose(); //logs searched directories
rf.setDefaultConfigFile("config.ini"); //specifies a default configuration file
rf.configure(argc, argv);
\endcode

Now we can put \e config.ini in one of the data directories defined by YARP. A possible option is the directory .local/share/yarp/contexts inside the home of the user (in windows this is \%APPDATA\%/yarp/contexts, see \ref yarp_data_dirs for more details). By default this is the first place in which the ResourceFinder searches for files if not instructed with a precise path (like in this case).

To avoid confusions and clashes with other similar files we keep the file inside the directory \e randomMotion; we call this directory a \e context for the module rf_basic.

\code
cp -r ../randomMotion/ $HOME/.local/share/yarp/contexts
\endcode

Now from any working directory in the computer you can run your module and it will read parameters from $HOME/.local/share/yarp/contexts/randomMotion/config.ini and do its job.

To do this we can run rf_basic with the parameter `--context`:

\code
./rf_basic --context randomMotion
[...]
|| found /home/nat/.local/share/yarp/contexts/randomMotion/config.ini
Running with:
robot: robby
part: head
joint: 0
\endcode

This is useful because:

\li the context directory can contain more than a single file, by changing only this directory we change the whole configuration of the module with a single command;
\li YARP defines a set of places that can contain context directories, in our example the \e randomMotion folder can be installed with the executable and located at runtime without the user providing its exact path (which is system dependent).

In fact we can now create another directory to store a different configuration file. This file could for example configure rf_basic to connect to a simulator and move joint number 2 of the arm.

We create a new directory and add there a new file:

\code
mkdir $HOME/.local/share/yarp/contexts/randomMotionSim
\endcode

Create with your preferred editor a file called \e config.ini that contains the following lines:

\code
robot robbySim
part right_arm
joint 2
\endcode

Put the file in the directory \e randomMotionSim you just created.

We run:

\code
./rf_basic --context randomMotionSim
[...]
|| found /home/nat/.local/share/yarp/contexts/randomMotionSim/config.ini
Running with:
robot: robbySim
part: right_arm
joint: 2
\endcode

If you wish, you can specify a 'defaultContext' to be used when no parameters are given to the module.

Just add the following line after the call to setDefaultConfigFile():

\code
rf.setDefaultContext("randomMotion");
\endcode

Now running:

\code
./rf_basic
[...]
|| found /home/nat/.local/share/yarp/contexts/randomMotion/config.ini
Running with:
robot: robby
part: head
joint: 0
\endcode

Before you move to the next tutorials it is better to cleanup your $HOME directory:

\code
rm -rf $HOME/.local/share/yarp/contexts/randomMotion
rm -rf $HOME/.local/share/yarp/contexts/randomMotionSim
\endcode

\section rf_basic_discussion Discussion
We have seen how the ResourceFinder facilitates passing parameters to a module from a file. The ResourceFinder follows particular
rules to locate configuration files that allow, for example, to switch the "initialization context" from which a module will be configured.

For simplicity, in the above example, we used specific Linux commands and directories. Adapting this tutorials to other operating systems should be strightforward.

Normally context directories are not copied manually to the home of the user, but they are installed together with other contexts in YARP's directories and managed with the yarp-config tool. The tutorial \ref yarp_resource_finder_installation describes how to use CMake to configure your build so that configuration files are automatically installed and it links to the yarp-config help page.

More insights on the ResourceFinder are given in a more advanced tutorial \ref yarp_resource_finder_advanced. See also the yarp::os::ResourceFinder class documentation.
