## bert
"bert" is a DIY robot development project based on ["Poppy"](https://www.poppy-project.org/en/) from [GenerationRobots](https://www.generationrobots.com/en/278-poppy-humanoid-robot). The name is assigned in the hope that the robot will dance as Dick van Dyke's character in "Mary Poppins". We have a long ways to go.
