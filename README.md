## bert
"Bert" is a DIY robot development project based on the [Poppy](https://www.poppy-project.org/en/) platform from [GenerationRobots](https://www.generationrobots.com/en/278-poppy-humanoid-robot). Bert is a reduced stature (83cm) humanoid. The name is assigned in the hope that the robot will dance as Dick van Dyke's character in "Mary Poppins". We have a long ways to go.
