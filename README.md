## bert
"Bert" is a DIY robot development project based on the open-source version of the [Poppy](https://www.poppy-project.org/en/) platform developed by [Generation Robots](https://www.generationrobots.com/en/278-poppy-humanoid-robot). Bert is a reduced stature (83cm) humanoid. The name is assigned in the hope that the robot will dance as Dick van Dyke's character in "Mary Poppins". We have a long ways to go.


 For further details see the [architecture](http://github.com/chuckcoughlin/bert/tree/master/docs/architecture.md), [toolchain](https://github.com/chuckcoughlin/bert/tree/master/docs/toolchain.md), [test plan](https://github.com/chuckcoughlin/bert/tree/master/docs/testplan.md), [implementation](https://github.com/chuckcoughlin/bert/tree/master/docs/implementation.md) and [user-guide](http://github.com/chuckcoughlin/bert/tree/master/docs/user-guide.md) documents.
 The test plan contains current testing status and is a good indication of the project's progress. A prior version of the robot written in `Java` for the `Odroid-XU4` processor is stored on the `version1` branch. The current version is written in `Kotlin` for the `Odroid-N2+`
