# User Guide

This document is a "how-to" user guide describing techniques required to operate specific features of the Bert robot.
Refer to [implementation](http://github.com/chuckcoughlin/bert/tree/master/docs/implementation.md) for detailed descriptions of feature designs and the code behind them.

*********************************************************
### Speech <a id="speech"></a>
  The primary method of command and control is via spoken English commands. If a command, statement or question is not recognized, Bert will respond with an appropriate request for clarification. A typical interaction
  may be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoP7b5YDawg)
*********************************************************
#### a - Startup <a id="startup"></a>
Once the robot is powered on, a boot sequence commences. On completion, Bert announces a randomized "Ready" statement.
*********************************************************
#### b - Example Statements <a id="example"></a>
The lists below show typical statements that Bert will recognize.
The full range of understanding comes from combining these patterns with
options from the vocabulary list in the next section.
##### Commands
```
  describe your configuration
  halt
  list the speeds of your motors
  move your left knee to 135 degrees
  move it to 120 degrees
  move the other knee to 120 degrees
  move slowly
  straighten up
```
Commands also include directives to set poses. The command is simply the pose name.
```
   attention
   relax
```
Pose names are not fixed parts of the syntax, but rather names of stored entries in
the robot database.

For additional examples see [testplan](https://github.com/chuckcoughlin/bert/tree/master/docs/testplan.md).

##### Queries
```
    How old are you
    what are the limits on your right elbow (EEPROM hard limits)
    what are the targets for your neck horizontal (position, speed, torque)
    What is your height
    What is the id of your left shoulder vertical
    What is the vertical position of your neck
    what is your left ankle temperature
    why do you wear mittens
```
##### Settings
Infrequently it may be necessary to inform the robot of some fact.
```
  you are "sitting"
  save your pose as "saluting"
  "sit" means to become "sitting"
  when I say "sit" take the pose "sitting"
```
*********************************************************
#### Poses
A *Pose* is a static positioning of the robot.
It is defined by the combined positions of all the joints. The following shows a sequence of steps
that save an arbitrary pose whose positions are created by manual intervention.
A subsequent section will demonstrate combining poses to create an action.

 After startup joints are set to support maximum load and can't be bent by hand.
```
    relax your right arm
```
At this point the torque for the right elbow and associated shoulder joints is disabled.
They can be moved manually to any desired position. Note that the leg "limb" includes hips.
```
  hold it
```
Stiffen the arm, holding it in place so that another limb can be manipulated.
```
  freeze
```
This command freezes all joints as the robot is currently positioned.

  Next, assign a name to the current position
of the robot.   NOTE: In the
samples that follow, names that are substitutable parameters are shown in quotes.
The quotes should not be used when typing commands into the terminal application
as they will not be generated by the speech processor. Likewise the name itself must
be chosen to match the spelling that will be used by the tablet spoken text generator.
```
    your pose is "saluting"
    you are "sitting"
    save that pose
```
Any of these commands record the pose positions in the robot's internal database. If no name
is given a number will be assigned. Note that the pose is now stored on the robot. If the
development machine holds the canonical form of the database, then rows added to the "pose"
table will need to be exported and imported onto the development machine.

A video example of this process may be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lilrxy11Ac).

### c - Vocabulary <a id="vocabulary"></a>
"Bert" has a fixed vocabulary when it comes to names of parameters in
various categories.
  * Appendages: ear, eye, finger, nose, toe
  * Axes: x, y, z, horizontal, vertical
  * Body parts (joints): abs, ankle, arm, bust, chest, elbow, head, hip,
  knee, neck, shoulder
  * Commands: exit, freeze, halt, relax, shutdown, stop
  * Core property: age, cadence, cycle time, duty cycle, height, name
  * Joint Properties: id, maximum angle, minimum angle, motor type, offset,
     orientation, position, speed, temperature, torque, voltage
  * Limbs: arm, leg, torso
  * Sides: left, right, other

*********************************************************
  ### Android Application <a id="android"></a>
  [toc](#table-of-contents)

The Android tablet is a vital part of the robot control system. It provides
voice services (both interpretive (listening) and spoken). The tablet must be
within ~10' for Bluetooth communication. It may be placed conveniently in the
backpack worn by the robot.

The control application is called ***BertSpeak***, and, while it must be running,
there is no necessary interactive control other than speech. The screens shown
below provide some minimal troubleshooting capabilities.

Make sure that the application is configured in the Settings with Permission for Microphone and Storage.
Additionally, under Settings->General Management, choose the preferred text-speech engine.
(I chose Samsung over Google). Install voice data (I chose a British male).

*********************************************************
  ![BertSpeak](/images/bertspeak_cover.png)
 ```                        BertSpeak - Cover Page ```</br>
  The **cover** panel shows the current state of connection with the main robot
  processor.   
  ********************************************************
   ![BertSpeak](/images/bertspeak_settings.png)
 ```                        BertSpeak - Settings Page ```</br>
    It is important that the settings be filled in before attempting to use the tablet
    for robot control. The **Settings** page should show the following values:

  ```
    Paired Device         bert_humanoid
    Simulated Connection  false  (true is used with the Android simulator during development)
  ```
